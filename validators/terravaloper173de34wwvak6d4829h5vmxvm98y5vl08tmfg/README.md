The Rockaway Blockchain Fund is VC investor into digital assets since 2017. We are also investors in Terra since 2019. As part of our value-add we are running node infrastructure for projects we have invested in.

## Security
In terms of physical security, the hardware is located in Tier III datacenter with access available only based on national ID cards, there are currently 2 persons authorized to access the hardware in DC.

In terms of software security all servers are Linux based with access available only via authorized SSH keys, through internal VPN. Keys to the node accounts (i.e., consensus keys) are stored on separate bare metal machine only accessible within internal network, which is behind strict firewall. The keys themselves are loaded on Yubico Hardware Security Modules. Seeds to the keys are sharded and are safely held by multiple parties.


## Our Architecture

We use dedicated physical servers from multiple vendors in secure and enviromentally friendly TIA942/Tier III datacenteres with low PUE. Our Primary Datacenter is located in Prageu, Czech republic and only 2 persons are authorized for both physical and remote access. Our validator uses dedicated machine with Yubico HSM for signing the blocks. We respect best security and reliability practices (i.e. having least possible amount of keys on servers,...)
 
## Decentralization
By having our own physical nodes outside of the common colocation centers (i.e. most of the Solana nodes are run in Hetzner DCs â€“ Falkenstein and Helsinky account for cca 30% of nodes), we are substantially improving decentralization of the networks.

## Team
Our team is full of blockchain enthusiasts and engineers.
